        <main>
        <p>My name is Ryann Gholston. I am in the iSchool majoring in Information Management and Technology
            with a concentration in web development. I hope to pursue a career in UX/UI. 
            Some of my <strong>accomplishments</strong> at SU include being an Our Time Has Come Scholar and becoming the Social Media Chair for BLISTS. 
            Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with friends, listening to music, and eating! My favorite show on Netflix is Black Mirror.
