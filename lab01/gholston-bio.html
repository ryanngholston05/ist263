        "My name is Ryann Gholston. I am in the iSchool majoring in Information Management and Technology
        with a concentration in web development. I hope to pursue a career in UX/UI. 
        Some of my accomplishments at SU include being an Our Time Has Come Scholar and becoming the Social Media Chair for BLISTS. 
        Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with friends, listening to music, and eating! My favorite show on Netflix is Black Mirror."
